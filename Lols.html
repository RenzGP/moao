<h2>Tourism</h2>
<p> Aurora is endowed with a plethora of natural tourism attractions.  
Its waterfalls, beaches, historic sites, lush green mountains,  
and blue ocean seas, as well as the verdant country pastures and farmlands,
 are breathtaking. The majority of these natural wonders have remained untouched.
  Tourism might thus be viewed as a potentially significant growth business.  </p>
